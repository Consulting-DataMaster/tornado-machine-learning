# Predicting tornado magnitude with Machine Learning
Repository containing the Capstone project I performed at General Assembly, London, for the Data Science Immersive course (June-Sept 2017)

This capstone project consists of 5 notebooks:

- Part 1: First analysis of the data and modelling on a subset of 500 tornadoes.

- Web Scraping: Importing a bigger dataset from the web and saving as a local PostgreSQL

- Part 3: work on the dataset of tornadoes which magnitude was measured with EF scale (2007-2017). 
        Final EDA, more modelling, NLP and time series analysis.

- Pre-Processing class: Gathering of all the pre-processing steps of part 3 in a single class.

- Part 5: Upsampling, further NLP testing and a first glance at predicting damage costs.
